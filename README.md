# GDscript Preprocessor

Preprocessor for godot 4.5 gdscript. Adds some nice features that aren't possible in gdscript.

Still somewhat experimental, there are likely some edge cases that can result in broken output. The compiler also doesn't report hardly any errors, it mostly just passes everything straight to gdscript. Please make an issue if you find any bugs.
